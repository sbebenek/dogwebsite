<h1>Dog Website</h1>
<p>This website was developed as a passion project by Sam Bebenek in 2020 as a way to practice React and Express development. Dog Website is a single-page content management system that features React routing, authenticated logins, image uploading, and pagination. It is styled with a combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS. The back-end is an Express RESTful API application that connects to a MySQL database.</p>
<p>With more time to develop this website, I'd liked to include a responsive design, personal user accounts, multiple images per dog, internal messaging, and shelter pages.</p>
